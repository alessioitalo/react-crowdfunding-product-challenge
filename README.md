### What I learned

Probably the hardest Frontend Mentor challenge yet! 

When I started this challenge, my main goal was to get to practice with styled components, but I immediately realised the project was actually pretty complex. 

It took me hours of work and a lot of struggle, but I am really happy with the final result. And of course, I feel much more confident with styled components!

### Continued development

In my next project, I would like to start exploring more complex ways to handle state: so far, I have always only sticked to the useState hook.
